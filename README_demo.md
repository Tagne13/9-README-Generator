  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  Generate a SVG logo with options of shape (circle, square, or triangle), shape color, text (limit of 3 characters), and text color. Shape and text colors can be chosen using color keywords or hexadecimal numbers.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  Check if Node.js is installed by typing 'node -v' in the command line/terminal. Next, clone this project repository to your local machine. Use the command 'npm install' to install dependencies. Use the command 'npm install --save-dev-jest' to install Jest as a devDependency.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  Change directories toy uor new project folder in the terminal/command line. Invoke the app by typing 'node index.js' or by typing the script npm start in the terminal/command line. You will be asked a series of questions before your logo is generated. Once all prompts have been answered with accepted values, your new logo will be generated with the file name 'logo.svg' in the 'samples' folder. Refer back to the video posted in this README as needed.
